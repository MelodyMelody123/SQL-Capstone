What I have learnt :

SQL is a useful tool to use for queries and data analysis. There are a lot of variation of analysis that can be done. 


What I would change:

If given the opportunity to be able to solely focus on conducting the queries, instead of having to juggle other happenings in life, more in depth analysis can be carried out. 


Challenges faced   :

It was done amidst overseas work trip. I was striving to complete all within tight schedule and working with multiple things.
